# Skill-Swap
A platform that facilitates skill exchanges within a community. Users can offer skills they are willing to teach (e.g., programming, cooking, music lessons) and look for skills they want to learn. The platform serves as a marketplace for non-monetary exchanges, fostering a sense of community and personal growth.

### Core Features:

- **Messaging System:** Include a secure messaging feature for users to discuss the logistics of their skill exchange.
- **Feedback and Rating System:** After a skill swap session, users can leave feedback and rate their experience, helping to maintain a trustworthy community.
- **Resource Sharing:** Provide a feature for users to share resources (articles, videos, tools) related to their skills, further supporting the learning experience.
